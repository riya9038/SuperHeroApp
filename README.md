# SuperHeroApp

<li>This is a repository for SuperHero App using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS.</li>
<br>
<li> It is developed with interesting features to provide users a digital yet real-life experience.</li>
<br>

# Problem Statement

Create a superhero hunter app. Use ONLY vanilla javascript, no libraries or frameworks allowed for Javascript (you can use any css framework like Bootstrap).

<br>

# Features Required

- <b>Home Page</b><br>

  - Search any superhero from the API and display the search results on the frontend (as I type the search results should update, just like Google does for suggestions).
  - Each search result of the superhero should have a favourite button, clicking on which the superhero should be added to “My favourite superheroes” (a list).
  - On clicking any particular search result (any superhero), open a new page with more information about that superhero (Superhero page).

- <b>Superhero Page</b> <br>

  - Should show a lot of information about the superhero like their name, photo, powerstats, bio (these are must, rest you can add if you want).

- <b>My favourite superheroes Page</b> <br>

  - Display a list of all the favourite superheroes.
  - Make this list persistent (should have the same number of superheroes before and after closing the browser).
  - Remove from favourites button: Each superhero should have remove from favourites button, clicking on which should remove that superhero from the list.
